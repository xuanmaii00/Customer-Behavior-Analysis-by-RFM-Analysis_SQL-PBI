### RFM Analysis_SQL/ Power BI
## I/ Introduction
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a technique used to identify and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This method evaluates three key dimensions:
  + Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase, indicating their engagement level with the brand.
  + Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases within a specific timeframe, reflecting their loyalty and relationship with the brand.
  + Monetary: The total amount of money a customer spends, highlighting their value to the business.
- By analyzing these dimensions, businesses can better understand customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies to improve retention and increase sales.
- In this project, I conducted an RFM analysis for Adventure Works, a bicycle manufacturer and seller, to identify high-value customer segments. By leveraging customer transaction data, I aimed to uncover insights into purchasing behaviors, enabling the company to optimize its marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. The analysis provided a comprehensive view of customer segments, facilitating targeted campaigns to improve retention and drive sales growth.

## III/ Insights and Recommendations
We can gather the customer segments into 4 main groups to take action:  
- **Top value**: Champions, Loyal -> contribute most of the revenue to the company, has supreme CLV and show the best buying behavior
- **Need retention**: Cannot Loose Them, At Risk, Need Attention, Hibernating -> contribute quite considerably to the company revenue, has quite hight CLV and we are loosing them
- **Need Conversion**: Promising, Potential Loyalist, New Customer -> new users that contribute quite noteworthy can be turned into Champions or Loyal
- **No action**: About to sleep, Lost Customer -> consist of quite large number of customers but do not contribute much to the company revenue and has extremely low CLV

From the above groups, I suggest the strategy for each group:
- **Top value**: Implement exclusive loyalty programs or rewards to recognize and appreciate their continued support
    + Tiered Loyalty Programs: Reward customers based on spending, with higher tiers unlocking exclusive perks like early product access, VIP service, or discounts.
    + Personalized Rewards: Offer discounts or free items based on customers' favorite products.
    + Exclusive Events: Host webinars, product previews, or in-person events to strengthen brand relationships
- **Need retention**: Use personalized communication and offers to re-engage these customers.
    + Reactivation Offers: Create offers that are sent exclusively to customers who have not made a purchase recently. These offers could include a significant discount or a free gift with their next purchase that align with their previous behavior.
    + Customer Feedback Loop: Reach out to these customers to ask for feedback on their experience with the brand. Use their responses to improve products or services and communicate the changes made based on their input.
    + Lapsed Customer Campaigns: Set up automated email campaigns that trigger when a customer hasn't interacted with the brand for a certain period.
    + Retargeting Ads: Use social media platforms to retarget these customers with ads that feature products theyâ€™ve shown interest in or remind them of items left in their cart.
    + Exclusive Memberships: Offer a subscription or membership program with perks such as regular discounts, early access to sales, or free shipping.
- **Need Conversion**: Focus resources on this group, provide introductory offers or discounts to encourage second-time purchases and increase engagement, spending with the brand.
    + Follow-Up Offers: Send a discount or bonus after the first purchase to encourage a second one. This could be a discount, free shipping, or a bonus item to encourage them to return quickly.
    + Onboarding Series: Develop an onboarding email series that welcomes new customers and educates them about products or services. Include tips, product recommendations, and special offers to guide them towards their next purchase.
    + Bundling Offers: Offer bundles of products at a discounted price to encourage these customers to try multiple items. This can exposes them to a wider range of the company offerings.
    + Time-Limited Discounts: Provide time-limited discounts that create a sense of urgency for these customers to make their next purchase.
