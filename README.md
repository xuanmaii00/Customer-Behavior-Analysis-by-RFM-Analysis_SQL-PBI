### RFM Analysis_SQL/ Power BI
## I/ Introduction
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a technique used to identify and segment customers based on their purchasing behavior. This method evaluates three key dimensions:
  + Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase, indicating their engagement level with the brand.
  + Frequency: How often a customer makes purchases within a specific timeframe, reflecting their loyalty and relationship with the brand.
  + Monetary: The total amount of money a customer spends, highlighting their value to the business.
- By analyzing these dimensions, businesses can better understand customer segments and tailor their marketing strategies to improve retention and increase sales.
- In this project, I conducted an RFM analysis for Adventure Works, a bicycle manufacturer and seller, to identify high-value customer segments. By leveraging customer transaction data, I aimed to uncover insights into purchasing behaviors, enabling the company to optimize its marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement. The analysis provided a comprehensive view of customer segments, facilitating targeted campaigns to improve retention and drive sales growth.
