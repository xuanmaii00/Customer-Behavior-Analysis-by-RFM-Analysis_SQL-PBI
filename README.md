## üß† Design Thinking Process  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Empathize ‚Äì Understanding Stakeholders‚Äô Needs  

To ensure the dashboard meets business needs, I analyzed stakeholder concerns using the **5W1H framework** and an **Empathy Map**.  

#### üéØ Key Stakeholders  
- **Marketing Professionals & Strategists** ‚Äì Use the dashboard to refine **campaign strategies** and **improve customer engagement**.  
- **Business & Data Analysts** ‚Äì Leverage insights to identify **customer trends**, **optimize segmentation**, and support **data-driven decisions**.  
- **E-commerce & Retail Decision-Makers** ‚Äì Utilize the dashboard to **enhance customer retention**, **allocate budgets efficiently**, and **boost sales performance**.  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges Faced  
- Lack of **structured customer insights**, leading to **ineffective targeting** and **wasted marketing spend**.  
- Difficulty in **prioritizing customers**, making it hard to **personalize campaigns**.  
- No **churn prevention strategy**, resulting in **lost revenue**.  

#### üîç 5W1H Analysis  

| **Question** | **Insight** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Who will use the dashboard?** | **Marketing professionals, business analysts, and e-commerce decision-makers** for **customer segmentation** and **campaign planning**. |
| **What problem does it solve?** | Provides **structured segmentation** to identify **high-value and at-risk customers**. |
| **When & Where is it used?** | - **Monthly meetings** for retention analysis. <br> - **Marketing campaign planning** to refine audience targeting. <br> - **Sales forecasting** to allocate budgets effectively. |
| **Why is it needed?** | - **Improves marketing precision**. <br> - **Optimizes customer retention efforts**. <br> - **Supports data-driven sales strategies**. |
| **How was the problem handled before?** | - **Relying on intuition** and **manual tracking**. <br> - **Running generic campaigns** with low engagement. |

#### üìù Empathy Map ‚Äì Understanding Stakeholder Perspectives  

| **Aspect** | **Insights from Stakeholders** |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Thinking & Feeling** | "How do we identify our **most valuable customers**?" <br> "How can we **prevent churn**?" |
| **Seeing** | **Unclear customer segmentation**, **broad marketing efforts**, **low conversion rates**. |
| **Saying & Doing** | "We need **data-driven targeting strategies**." <br> "We should **focus on retaining high-value customers**." |
| **Pain Points** | - **Marketing budget wasted** on low-value customers. <br> - No clear strategy to **reduce churn**. |
| **Gains** | - **Higher CLV** through better segmentation. <br> - **Improved marketing ROI** with precise targeting. <br> - **Reduced churn & increased loyalty**. |

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Define ‚Äì Establishing Key Metrics & Growth Formula  

#### üéØ North Star Metric: Defining Success  
To create a meaningful customer segmentation strategy, I define key success metrics that drive growth. My **North Star Metric (NSM)** is based on **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scoring**, providing a structured way to classify customers and track business performance.


#### üìå Growth Formula  
I define **customer segments** and evaluate their impact across **three dimensions**:

| **North Star Metric 1**  | **North Star Metric 2 (Optional)**  | **Dimension Group**  | **Group 1** | **Group 2** | **Group 3** | **Group 4** |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **RFM Score**  | Revenue Contribution by Segment | **Customer Segments** | Top Value | Need Retention | Need Conversion | No Action |
| **RFM Score**  | Regional Customer Trends | **Geographic Region** | Customer behavior patterns by region | | | |
| **RFM Score**  | Product Category Performance | **Product Segments** | Revenue share per product group | | | |


#### üìä When is Success Achieved?  
Success is measured when I can effectively categorize and analyze customer behavior across different segments.  

| **Dimension**         | **View**                                  | **Description**                                           | **Why?** |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **Customer Segments** | RFM-Based Customer Groups | Categorizing customers into **4 key segments**: Top Value, Need Retention, Need Conversion, No Action. | Enables targeted strategies for each segment. |
| **Geographic Region** | Regional Revenue Trends | Understanding customer trends in different regions. | Helps optimize marketing campaigns by location. |
| **Product Segments** | Product Performance Metrics | Revenue contribution by different product categories. | Supports inventory planning and product marketing. |

#### üìà Why Choose These Metrics?  
- **Clear & Measurable**: RFM scoring is easy to understand and implement.  
- **Predictive Power**: Helps anticipate future customer behavior.  
- **Strategic Value**: Provides actionable insights for marketing, sales, and retention strategies.  


### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Ideate ‚Äì Developing Actionable Insights  

### üìå Dashboard Structure  
| **Idea Name** | **Layer 0** ‚Äì High-Level Metrics | **Layer 1** ‚Äì Breakdown by One Dimension | **Layer 2** ‚Äì Breakdown by Two Dimensions | **Key Actionable Insights** |
|--------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Segments Overview** | RFM-Based Segments, grouped into 4 major action groups | - Revenue contribution by segment  <br> - Yearly revenue trends per segment <br> - Customer count per segment | - Revenue share of each segment within a group | Identify the most valuable segments and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. |
| **Top Value** | Avg. RFM Score of top customer groups | - Avg. cart size & order value per segment <br> - Avg. spending per product category | - Avg. basket value by country | Strengthen loyalty programs and exclusive offers for high-value customers. |
| **Need Retention** | Revenue trend of this group over time | - Key products driving revenue from this group <br> - Revenue trends for top products | - Product count & basket value trends over time <br> - Share of product categories per region | Implement personalized retention campaigns and optimize product offerings. |

## 4. üìä Key Insights & Visualizations  

### üîπ Customer Segmentation  
I categorize customers into four main groups to optimize engagement and revenue:  

- **üèÜ Top Value (Champions, Loyal)**: High-CLV customers who drive most of the revenue and exhibit the best purchasing behavior.  
- **üîÑ Need Retention (Cannot Lose Them, At Risk, Need Attention, Hibernating)**: Contribute significantly to revenue but are showing signs of disengagement.  
- **üöÄ Need Conversion (Promising, Potential Loyalist, New Customer)**: New or developing customers with strong potential to become loyal.  
- **‚ö†Ô∏è No Action (About to Sleep, Lost Customer)**: A large segment with minimal revenue contribution and very low CLV.
