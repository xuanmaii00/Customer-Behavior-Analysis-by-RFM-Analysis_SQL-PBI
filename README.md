## üß† Design Thinking Process  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Empathize ‚Äì Understanding Stakeholders‚Äô Needs  

To build an effective customer segmentation dashboard, we first engaged with key stakeholders to understand their challenges and expectations. Using the **5W1H framework** and an **Empathy Map**, we captured insights that shape our approach to **RFM-based segmentation**.  

#### üéØ Primary Stakeholder:  
**Sales & Marketing Managers** ‚Äì The end users of the dashboard, responsible for designing targeted strategies to improve retention, revenue, and engagement.  

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Challenge:  
There is no structured approach to understanding customer behavior and value, making it difficult to personalize marketing efforts and allocate budgets effectively.  

---

### üìå 5W1H Analysis  

| **Question** | **Insight** |
|-------------|------------|
| **Who will use the dashboard?** | Sales & Marketing Managers looking to identify valuable customers and optimize retention & acquisition strategies. |
| **What problem does it solve?** | Provides customer segmentation based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to prioritize high-value customers and re-engage at-risk ones. |
| **When and where will it be used?** | - In monthly strategy meetings to assess customer behavior.<br>- During marketing campaign planning to define targeting strategies.<br>- In sales forecasting and budgeting to allocate resources efficiently. |
| **Why is it needed?** | - Marketing struggles with broad, ineffective targeting.<br>- Sales lacks insights on which customers to nurture or recover.<br>- Customer retention is low due to untailored engagement. |
| **How has the problem been handled before?** | - Marketing used generalized campaigns without personalized offers.<br>- Sales relied on manual customer tracking, leading to inefficiencies.<br>- Decisions were based on intuition rather than data, causing missed opportunities. |

---

### üó∫Ô∏è Empathy Map ‚Äì Understanding Stakeholder Perspectives  

| **Aspect** | **Insights from Stakeholders** |
|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Thinking & Feeling** | "How do we identify customers with the highest potential?"<br>"Which groups need different engagement approaches?"<br>"How do we prevent customer churn?" |
| **Seeing** | Fragmented customer transaction data without clear segmentation.<br>Generic marketing campaigns with low conversion rates. |
| **Saying & Doing** | "We need more precise targeting for promotions."<br>"We should focus on retaining our most valuable customers."<br>"Churn prediction would help us act before losing customers." |
| **Pain Points** | - Marketing budget is wasted on low-engagement customers.<br>- No clear understanding of which customers contribute most to revenue.<br>- Difficulty in crafting personalized retention strategies. |
| **Gains** | - Improved customer lifetime value (CLV) through better segmentation.<br>- Increased marketing ROI with more precise targeting.<br>- Data-driven insights to reduce churn and improve loyalty. |

## III/ Insights and Recommendations
We can gather the customer segments into 4 main groups to take action:  
- **Top value**: Champions, Loyal -> contribute most of the revenue to the company, has supreme CLV and show the best buying behavior
- **Need retention**: Cannot Loose Them, At Risk, Need Attention, Hibernating -> contribute quite considerably to the company revenue, has quite hight CLV and we are loosing them
- **Need Conversion**: Promising, Potential Loyalist, New Customer -> new users that contribute quite noteworthy can be turned into Champions or Loyal
- **No action**: About to sleep, Lost Customer -> consist of quite large number of customers but do not contribute much to the company revenue and has extremely low CLV

From the above groups, I suggest the strategy for each group:
- **Top value**: Implement exclusive loyalty programs or rewards to recognize and appreciate their continued support
    + Tiered Loyalty Programs: Reward customers based on spending, with higher tiers unlocking exclusive perks like early product access, VIP service, or discounts.
    + Personalized Rewards: Offer discounts or free items based on customers' favorite products.
    + Exclusive Events: Host webinars, product previews, or in-person events to strengthen brand relationships
- **Need retention**: Use personalized communication and offers to re-engage these customers.
    + Reactivation Offers: Create offers that are sent exclusively to customers who have not made a purchase recently. These offers could include a significant discount or a free gift with their next purchase that align with their previous behavior.
    + Customer Feedback Loop: Reach out to these customers to ask for feedback on their experience with the brand. Use their responses to improve products or services and communicate the changes made based on their input.
    + Lapsed Customer Campaigns: Set up automated email campaigns that trigger when a customer hasn't interacted with the brand for a certain period.
    + Retargeting Ads: Use social media platforms to retarget these customers with ads that feature products they‚Äôve shown interest in or remind them of items left in their cart.
    + Exclusive Memberships: Offer a subscription or membership program with perks such as regular discounts, early access to sales, or free shipping.
- **Need Conversion**: Focus resources on this group, provide introductory offers or discounts to encourage second-time purchases and increase engagement, spending with the brand.
    + Follow-Up Offers: Send a discount or bonus after the first purchase to encourage a second one. This could be a discount, free shipping, or a bonus item to encourage them to return quickly.
    + Onboarding Series: Develop an onboarding email series that welcomes new customers and educates them about products or services. Include tips, product recommendations, and special offers to guide them towards their next purchase.
    + Bundling Offers: Offer bundles of products at a discounted price to encourage these customers to try multiple items. This can exposes them to a wider range of the company offerings.
    + Time-Limited Discounts: Provide time-limited discounts that create a sense of urgency for these customers to make their next purchase.
